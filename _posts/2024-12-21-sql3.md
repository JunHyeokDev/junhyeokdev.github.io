# SQL

# Prob1

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Input Format

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:

![Desktop View](/assets/sql/occupations.png){: width="700" height="400" }


Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

Sample Input

![Desktop View](/assets/sql/sample_input.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Sample Output

```text
Jenny    Ashley     Meera  Jane
Samantha Christeen  Priya  Julia
NULL     Ketty      NULL   Maria
```
**Explanation**

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.


# approach

It took long time to solve... I had no idea what is the Pivot and how it works.

So I decided to solve it in the brute-force way, and then utilize the Pivot feature.

## Make a tmp table

```sql
with ranked as (

    select
        name,
        occupations,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (partition by occupation order by name) as rn
    from occupations
)
```

| Name | occupation | number |
|---|---|---|
| Alice | Doctor | 1 |
| Bob | Doctor | 2 |
| Charlie | Professor | 1 |
| David | Professor | 2 |
| Eve | Singer | 1 |

Now, we have table like this!

## query it name by occupation!

```sql
select 
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Doctor' and rn = t.rn),
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Professor' and rn = t.rn),
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Singer' and rn = t.rn),
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Actor' and rn = t.rn)
from (select distinct rn from ranked) as t
order by rn;
```

## Answer

```sql
with ranked as (

    select
        name,
        occupations,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (partition by occupation order by name) as rn
    from occupations
)

select 
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Doctor' and rn = t.rn),
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Professor' and rn = t.rn),
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Singer' and rn = t.rn),
    (select name from ranked where occupation = 'Actor' and rn = t.rn)
from (select distinct rn from ranked) as t
order by rn;
```
